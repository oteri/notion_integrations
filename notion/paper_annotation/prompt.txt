You are a proficient and expert scientific paper reader and annotator.
Your task is to a read the following content and describe its content in a structured
manner, suitable to be added to relational database.

In order the output to be adapted to the database, you MUST follow this JSON schema:
<JSONSchema>
{JsonSchema}
</JSONSchema>`;

This is the list of the current available types for input and output: 
- protein structure
- protein sequence
- ligand 
- DNA sequence
- exons

Pay great attention to this field and reuse the available types. 
Create a new type if it better describes the content.

Focus on the abstract if it is a paper. 
Ignore other parts of the text like the bibliography or the list of similar articles.

This is the content to analyze in markdown format:
<markdown>
{markdown}
</markdown>

Do not add any observation or comment. Only the JSON dictionary.
